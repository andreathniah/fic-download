After that they helped him change his clothes to a comfortable night dress and readied his bed by warming up the sheets with a few hot bricks.</span></p><p>Kyungsoo laid awake in the middle of his queen-sized bed. He was tired to death, his stomach was full, and the bed was satisfyingly comfortable, but he couldn’t sleep a wink that night.</span></p><p>_____________________________________________________________________________________________</span></p><p>Kyungsoo thought that he would be left to sleep for as long as he wished to, but the same omega maids from the previous night came to wake him up as soon as the sunrise. When they arrived, he was comfortably resting on his side with his back turned to the room’s wide window, and he was enjoying the soft caress of the sun’s rays with the pleasant cool early morning on his milky white skin.</span></p><p>One of the girls pulled the sheer see through curtain of the canopy bed aside and gave him the tray of his breakfast before leaving to help the other girl to prepare his bath. They filled the tub with steaming hot water with a couple of milk pitchers which he didn’t bother to keep the count of.</span></p><p>If it was anybody else they might have been so thrilled by all of this unnecessary attention, but Kyungsoo was over with this kind of lifestyle. He has been pampered his entire life, even more than his brothers considering the fact that he was the youngest of the three of them, and an omega on top of that. Thus, he ate his breakfast in silence and waited for the girls to finish preparing the bath. They even added scented oils and flower petals to the water, nothing that he wasn’t used to.</span></p><p>He put the tray aside and walked into the bathroom. The omegas striped him out of his night dress and guided him into the water. </span></p><p>During the whole time that the maids were busy bathing him, Kyungsoo was tempted to throw them out so he could take his bath in silence and peace. He hated not having any form of control over what was going on around him. He knew that the faster they finish their job the faster that he would be left alone, even if it was for a few minutes, so he swallowed his pride and let them do whatever they wished to do.</span></p><p>When they were almost done and Kyungsoo was standing out of the tub waiting for the girls to attend to him, the bathroom’s door was opened and an elderly beta lady walked in without much noise.</span></p><p><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">She shamelessly ogled his body and inspected the different sides of his form, then with an approving nod and a slight bow left the place. Kyungsoo didn’t even have to think to know who the woman was and why she eyed him like that. It was an old tradition to check the omegas before the mating and the woman, probably the royal physician, was there to make sure that there was no flaw on his body that King Jongin might not find pleasant to look at. He was an omega after all, an omega with a title…</span></p><p>After the long suffocating bath, his body was massaged with a sweet smelling oil and dressed into the traditional royal robe of King Jongin’s kingdom. The robe was made out of fine violet silk fabric. Although there wasn’t anything extremely special about the clothing or the fabric, the color was what made it special. Ages ago, violet was a color that was exclusive to the emperors and their consorts, mainly because the pigment used in dyeing the fabric was so hard to attain. Thus, it used to be really expensive. Although everyone was allowed to wear the color these days, they still had to say their vows in that color.</span></p><p>______________________________________________________________________________________________</span></p><p>The wedding ceremony was held at the capital's grand church. When Kyungsoo arrived to the said place, King Jongin and the head priest were already there waiting for him so they could begin the ritual. He was guided to the front were King Jongin was anticipating his arrival.<br><br>They were going to get married in front of the eyes of god and the people who had gathered there, and the officials who dutifully attended their wedding.</span></p><p><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">In the front row were a few royal guests, but there was no trace of his or king Jongin’s family. Kyungsoo wondered if the king’s relatives knew about this bounding.</span></p><p><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">When he was finally standing at his assigned place, the priest began his speech by talking about the importance and benefits of their marriage. Kyungsoo stopped listening to his rants five minutes after its beginning. He was brought back to present when they were finally asked about their consent, which they dutifully answered yes.</span></p><p>Kyungsoo wasn’t ready for what happened next; he closed his eyes and anticipated the mating bite that never happened. Instead of the bite he felt the soft, warm press of King Jongin’s lips on his forehead, and before he could register what was taking place around him there was a heavy weight placed on his head.</span></p><p><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">He opened his eyes and looked at the alpha king questioningly, before a man, another alpha, approached them. He was carrying a cushion with a crown sitting at the center of it. When the king placed the crown on his own head he realized that he was wearing the alpha’s, his alpha’s, crown.</span></p><p>He watched the crowd, whose cheering shouts were now deafening in horror, as the king dropped his heavy cloak on Kyungsoo’s narrow shoulders and hugged him by his waist. Then he heard the king say: “I now present to you king Kim Kyungsoo of the Kim dynasty. May the god bless each and every one of us and help him at doing his duty to our honourable citizens. I have decided to share my title and my authorities with my husband.”</span></p><p>Kyungsoo couldn’t believe his ears. Even his mother with her positive way of thinking never predicted this.</span></p><p>The carriage itself was not much different from the one that he saw the king using upon his arrival. What made him almost sure that this one was more special was the simpler interior and overly done exterior design of the carriage, clearly made for showing off or catching attention, with a touch of King Jongin’s personality that Kyungsoo was trying so hard to understand.</span></p><p>Kyungsoo had a lot of questions clogging his mind, but the king didn’t look a bit like he was in the right mood. Besides, he wondered if the king would get offended by getting questioned by an omega. As much as kyungsoo hated himself for letting such stereotypes affect him, he needed to be cautious. He was going to be in the mercy of this alpha for the rest of his life, so he thought to himself that it would be best for him to get closer to the alpha before showing his real personality to him.</span></p><p>In the carriage, King Jongin was sitting at the opposite end of the bench in front of Kyungsoo. He closed his eyes and let a low groan escape his mouth before massaging his temples. He was probably suffering from a headache, Kyungsoo concluded.</span></p><p>Upon their arrival to the palace they were escorted to a massive ballroom that Kyungsoo hadn’t seen before. Despite the size of the room, it was filled with guests who were mostly sporting cheerful faces and were enjoying themselves. Some of them were chatting in small or big groups, and the rest of them were either enjoying their drinks and treats or dancing to the symphony’s melodies.</span></p><p><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">Kyungsoo was stunned; back at their palace he wasn’t really allowed to join such events although as far as he could tell there were as many omegas among the guests as alphas. There were many servants mingling between the attendances to make sure that they were all served properly.</span></p><p>Kyungsoo did not know for how long he has been transfixed on his spot, it could have been for seconds or for minutes, but he just found it hard to take his eyes away from the party. King Jongin, on the other hand, looked as unfazed as before in the church and his face was barely readable. Kyungsoo wasn’t sure if he should try to make a small talk with him or leave him alone and try not to bother him. He decided to follow his second thought luckily, the king was soon distracted by greeting his guests.</span></p><p>Even with their lack of communication King Jongin, never left Kyungsoo’s side and the omega was thankful for that.</span><span style="font-size:8pt;">After the long and suffocating time spent socializing with their guests, it was time for dinner. Kyungsoo had no idea how to go to the dining room, and he was too stubborn to ask King Jongin for directions. He simply followed everybody else’s steps to the hall, missing his newly wedded husband on his way.</span></p><p><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">Upon his entrance to the room he didn’t have to try to find his assigned spot at the table. King Jongin was already sitting at the centre of the long dining table, and the chair at his right side was left unoccupied for Kyungsoo. He made his way over quietly and tried his best to not to catch anybody’s attention, although that was impossible.</span></p><p><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">People were whispering harsh judgments behind his back. Although he expected their reactions to be worse, even that was enough to ruin his already unstable mood. He was alone in a foreign land between foreigners who thought he was unworthy of their king and found him a threat to themselves. There were fathers and mothers who were telling others how their daughters or sons were much prettier and educated than him, or going as far as telling others how Kyungsoo’s family had bribed the king to take him as his mate.</span></p><p>Kyungsoo sat by the man and held his head low. He told himself that he didn’t do it out of shame or shyness; he just did it because he was tired of fighting for other's respect. He thought that just for this time he didn’t have to look at these people’s eyes, He wasn’t going to live with them after all.</span></p><p>He barely noticed it as his plate gradually became full of different sorts of foods. He tried his best to get something into his belly, but his nerves and his nausea were killing him, so he ended up only playing with his food and occasionally taking a sip from his wine. King Jongin had refused to bite him in front of the people back at the church that evening. Kyungsoo wished that he was stupid and didn’t realize the reluctance or maybe hesitation, but he wasn’t stupid. He probably had a lover who wasn’t Kyungsoo, and he didn’t bother to talk to him and the omega in Kyungsoo was sulking for the lack of the older alpha’s attention.</span></p><p>After the dinner, Kyungsoo expected to hear a long, boring speech from the king, but it didn’t happen. Nothing went as he expected after all. King Jongin stood up and reached his hand out for Kyungsoo, who looked at his hand with a frown that screamed of his internal confusion.</span></p><p>“Won’t you take my hand?!”</span></p><p>Kyungsoo hurriedly held the alpha’s outstretched hand and raised from his seat, and then let the man drag him back to the center of the ballroom. Kyungsoo stared at his eyes for a few seconds.</span></p><p>“Why did his majesty want to come here?”</span></p><p>“To dance, obviously.”</span></p><p>The orchestra began playing a soft romantic rhythm as the king raised their intertwined hands and placed his other hand around Kyungsoo’s curvy waist. The omega, although taken aback, followed suit and put his free hand on the king's strong shoulder. The alpha took the lead. He carefully kept a respectful distance between their bodies while maintaining his eye contact with Kyungsoo until the song came to its end and it was time to part away from each other.</span></p><p><span style="font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">King Jongin, as expected from any gentleman, held Kyungsoo’s hand and brought his omega's slender knuckles to his lips to place a chaste kiss on them before bowing to him and dragging him out of the ballroom, ignoring their audience’s applaud.</span></span></p><div><div><div class="msocomtxt">He took a deep breath and loosened his grip on Kyungsoo's hand, and then softly muttered a “sorry… I was holding your hand a little bit uhh… Harder than I should've.”</span></p><p>Kyungsoo looked up at him for a while as if trying to decipher what the alpha had just said. </span></p><p>“It's alright. I'm not hurt your majesty.”</span></p><p>“Great.”</span></p><p>King Jongin stopped by a door and pointed at it.</span></p><p>“Would you like to talk for a while.” </span></p><p>Kyungsoo nodded and they entered the room. It was a spare guest bedroom with a few colorful bottles of wine placed on the coffee table across from the bed and two single chairs near it. King Jongin removed his coat and sat down on one the chairs waiting for the omega to follow suit, but Kyungsoo looked a little lost at the middle of the room. </span></p><p>King Jongin poured himself a drink and drank it in one go. He heard the omega’s low sigh before he came into his view, but instead of sitting down on the opposite chair he took the glass away from the alpha and lifted his shaky hands toward the king's chest to his clothes. The alpha was surprised he held the omega's fists in his own to stop him.</span></p><p>“What are you doing, Kyungsoo?!”</span></p><p><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">“I just wanted to help you out of your clothes your highness.” The omega shyly answered while trying not to look at the King.</span></p><p>“Why would you do that?”</span></p><p>Kyungsoo looked at him for a brief second and avoided his questioning stare again with hot cheeks.<br>The King didn't need any answers to know what Kyungsoo thought they were about to do.</span></p><p>“Please sit down Kyungsoo.” The omega hesitantly sat down.</span></p><p>“Would you like something to drink?”</span></p><p>Kyungsoo shook his head. “No, thank you your highness. I rather be sober when we consummate our marriage.</span></p><p>“We are not going to.” The king answered, seemingly offended.</span></p><p>“Then- </span>“</p><p>“I didn’t expect a wise omega like you to think so low of me.”</span></p><p>“Neither did I think that the idea of ing me would be so unpleasant to his highness.” Kyungsoo said his voice dripping fake sarcasm.</span></p><p>“Kyungsoo,” the alpha half growled warningly.</span></p><p>“What now your majesty?”</span></p><p>“I don’t know how things work in your father’s palace, but where I rule we don’t have to do anything just because that’s what seems to be the right thing to do, and right now I don’t know you enough to do anything beyond respecting your privacy.”</span></p><p>Kyungsoo stared at the alpha’s eyes challengingly. It was too soon to give himself away. He was this frail delicate omega for now, not the strong hot headed one because nobody wants an omega like that. After what felt like hours he finally averted his eyes, not because he was defeated, but because who was this arrogant alpha to reject an omega like Kyungsoo? It wasn’t like the alpha had never slept with a stranger just to satiate his lust, right? Was he being loyal to somebody else by avoiding Kyungsoo? </span></p><p>“I see.”</span></p><p>“are you mad?”</span></p><p>“about what?”</span></p><p>“I know omegas tend to fantasize about their wedding night.” Kyungsoo wasn't allowed to. Actually, he had no right to.</span></p><p>“What is your point?”</span></p><p>“Well, I apologize for not being able to make your dreams come true.”</span></p><p>“You don’t know a thing about my dreams. I had enough of you humiliating me for tonight. Now if you will excuse me, I would like to rest.”</span></p><p>“You can stay in this room since your personal chambers won’t be ready until tomorrow morning. I shall leave you now.”</span></p><p>The king left him alone and Kyungsoo hated him for making him feel so small. He sat at the end of the bed and drank a flute of champagne as he was thinking about his miserable life. He had been told and readied to be mate-less for his entire life, but then this cruel alpha had come out of nowhere and took him away from the only home that he knew, and without knowing how hard the whole situation was to kyungsoo he had tossed him away even easier than dragging him miles away and turning his world upside down.</span></p><p><br><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">He hadn’t even respected him enough to at least spend the night in the same room as him, as if the gossips weren’t already bad enough. Now everyone was going to be talking about his alpha rejecting him because of whatever sick reason that they could come up with.<br>With the brief braveness caused by alcohol he stood up, determined to avoid that outcome.</span></p><p><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">When he stepped out of the damned room still clad in his formal attire, he found the door way guarded by soldiers.</span></p><p>One must be a beta to be allowed to guard an omega from the royal family, unless their alphas thought their omega needed more protection and therefore the task would have been assigned to a qualified mated alpha. Kyungsoo always preferred dealing with alphas in this kind of situations because no matter how strict or harsh they were they always had a soft spot for pretty omegas such as Kyungsoo himself, and Kyungsoo had always used that against them, because why not when it always gets a job done the way he wants? These soldiers were not alphas, but that definitely did not stop them from giving in to his wishes.</span></p><p>He watched them carefully before choosing the one whom he knew would be the easiest target and then approached him gracefully with his head held high. The soldier had been watching him and fidgeting since the second he had opened the door.</span></p><p><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">He stopped his steps as he reached the beta and addressed him.</span></p><p>“Soldier.”</span></p><p>The man scanned his surroundings as if he wasn’t sure if kyungsoo was talking to him.</span></p><p>‘Easy prey,’ Kyungsoo thought.</span></p><p>“Aren’t you going to answer your omega king? Will your higher-ups approve this rudeness?”</span></p><p>the most movement that the soldiers where allowed was to breathe or maybe blink, they were not allowed to talk. Back at his own, or better said his father’s palace, they were not allowed to respond to Kyungsoo, but there he was the useless omega prince whereas here he was much more than that. More than anyone but the bastard king himself.</span></p><p>The soldier immediately turned to face him and bowed.</span></p><p>“Raise.” Kyungsoo coldly answered.</span></p><p>He wasn’t a mean individual, but life had taught him to be strict and stand his ground when nobody else did. It didn’t make him a bad person, but it sure made him a though omega. One that must have been taken seriously and not underestimated. Besides, who wouldn’t have been pissed off when an alpha had insulted him?</span></p><p>“What can this humble soldier do for his highness?”</span></p><p>Kyungsoo’s lips twitched to form a suppressed smirk.</span></p><p>“Tell me where his highness’ bed chamber is.”</span></p><p>The soldier hesitated for a second before he saw a passing by maid whom he beckoned to come closer.</span></p><p>“Take his highness to the king’s bed chambers.”</span></p><p>Kyungsoo couldn’t see the woman. He glanced her way from over his shoulder before turning around. The maid bowed to him just the way the soldier had done and then led the way.</span></p><p>“This way your highness.”</span></p><p>They turned from one hallway to another until the servant stopped by a massive oak wooden door and excused herself. Again, there were bulky gaurds standing by the door, alphas this time. He knew that he wasn’t allowed to see a king in his private rooms unless invited, or at least that was how it went in his last home, but he had to take the risks thus he kept his shoulders squared and tried not to let his anxiety affect his scent. The soldiers all sewed their gazes to the ground. Kyungsoo was their king’s spouse after all, they shouldn’t have ogled at him because the alpha could have them beheaded if they get caught doing that. It made the situation harder but Kyungsoo tried nevertheless.</span></p><p>“Open the door.” Kyungsoo ordered and hoped that they didn’t notice the slight shaking in his voice.</span></p><p>“We are not allowed your highness.” After a minute was passed in a heavy silence one of them said.</span></p><p>Kyungsoo looked him dead in the eyes, although the soldier was stubbornly avoiding his gaze and was still staring at the marble floor.</span></p><p>“Look at my eyes when you talk to me.” Kyungsoo said, and there was no time for wavering.</span></p><p>The solider looked at his eyes as he was ordered and Kyungsoo didn’t miss the bright redness of his cheeks as he did. The sight was familiar to him.</span></p><p>“I wish to have an audience with my mate now open this door for me.”</span></p><p>“… but your highness we can’t. We will lose our job if-“</span></p><p>“you will lose your job right now if you keep disobeying me.”</span></p><p>The soldiers shared a few looks but no one moved an inch. They were still blocking the door.</span></p><p>“Unless he is occupied with a right now step out of my way or I’ll make sure neither of you sees the sun coming up tomorrow.”</span></p><p>One of them stepped away and dragged the other one with him.</span></p><p>“Please excuse us your highness. We are in no position to disrespect his majesty.”</span></p><p>“you are forgiven.” Kyungsoo said before pushing the door open. Now it was time to deal with his alpha.</span></p> </div></div><div id="chapter-/story/view/1128859/6/violet-silk-angst-arrangedmarriage-mpreg-kaisoo-omegaverse-wolfau-royaltyau" class="row twelve columns chapter-container"><p style="font-weight: bold;">6 Chapter 06</p><div id="user-submitted-body" class="clearfix"><p><span style="font-family:Arial;">Kyungsoo walked inside. He crossed the waiting room fast and walked into the bedroom without bothering to knock. By the time he entered the room the king had already changed his clothes to comfortable night gowns. He was leaning on a sofa and had a scroll in his hands, the room dimly lit by a single candle near the king.</span></p><p>",""font-family:Arial;">Kyungsoo stood at the doorpost, and suddenly all of the courage that he mustered just a brief second ago had vanished as he stared at the man. The alpha looked so surreal and unreachable, even when he was there looking so gracious and glorious in his attire. Kyungsoo felt so small and pissed at himself for letting an alpha reduce him to that. The king hadn’t even acknowledging him and Kyungsoo was sure that he heard the door opening just now.</span></p><p>",""font-family:Arial;">After a minute or so the king finally pried his eyes away from the parchment in his hands. He looked surprised for a second before concealing his astonishment and plastering a small smile on his handsome face.

Instead he was lying on the left side of the bed with the silk duvet loosely draped over his body and one arm hung over his eyes.</span></p><p>",""font-family:Arial;">Kyungsoo wanted to follow suit but as soon as he approached the bed he remembered about the stiff attire that he had on. He worried his plump bottom lip, debating whether to wake the king up and ask him for clothes or just get rid of what he had on and hide his body under the soft inviting duvet. The alpha was probably still awake, but Kyungsoo thought he himself was far too tired to care about being practically bare. So, he began striping mindlessly.</span></p><p>",""font-family:Arial;">Upon hearing the rustling fabrics Jongin opened his eyes he glanced at the omega, whom much to his horror was standing nearly at the other side of the bed.</span></p><p><span style="font-family:Arial;">He didn’t realize that he was gawking at the omega until kyungsoo was staring at him with those gigantic deep brown eyes of his. He cleared his throat and pulled the cover aside to let Kyungsoo slide under it.</span></p><p>",""font-family:Arial;">“Jongin…” Kyungsoo whispered even too lowly for Jongin to hear. He even thought he was imagining hearing it but the tired, almost shy glance that Kyungsoo sent his way from over his narrow shoulder with his back turned to him proved his suspicion right.</span></p><p>",""font-family:Arial;">“Hmm?” He hummed.</span></p><p>",""font-family:Arial;">“You know… loosen up a little bit. I’m not going to jump you or something.”</span></p><p>",""font-family:Arial;">“I’m fine.”</span></p><p><br><br><span style="font-family:Arial;">“No, you are not, and although it's my fault it's really ridiculous because I’m the blushing omega bride here.” Kyungsoo finished his sleepy rant with a deep yawn that Jongin would have been startled to hear from such a petit omega but he knew better than underestimating the omega prince.</span></p><p>",""font-family:Arial;">“Groom.”</span></p><p>",""font-family:Arial;">“What?!”</span></p><p>",""font-family:Arial;">“You’re the Groom not a bride, you are-“</span></p><p>",""font-family:Arial;">“A man right. I was almost surprised when you called me a king back at the church. For some reason, I thought I would become the queen… “</span></p><p>",""font-family:Arial;">“Silly… the servants would want to see some evidence in the morning. How are you planning to provide that?”</span></p><p>",""font-family:Arial;">“I am no maiden my king. It’s enough that I’m almost .”</span></p><p>",""font-family:Arial;">“You care too much about what everyone thinks about this marriage, but ironically you are missing a big fact in here, my dear.”</span></p><p>",""font-family:Arial;">“What is it that I don’t know about?”</span></p><p>",""font-family:Arial;">“In this family as a tradition the omega doesn’t stay at the alpha’s bed. The alpha goes to the omega whenever he wants to seek the other’s company. So, you coming to my bedchambers is pretty much disrespectful for you at least. I don’t care about the gossip.”</span></p><p>",""font-family:Arial;">“My room isn’t ready.”</span></p><p>",""font-family:Arial;">“They don’t care about that, they will call you a- never mind this.”</span></p><p>",""font-family:Arial;">“I’m too tired for this.”</span></p><p>",""font-family:Arial;">“I know. And drop this pretense already.”</span></p><p>",""font-family:Arial;">“What are you talking about?”</span></p><p><span style="font-family:Arial;">“You are not really submissive or docile. I already know all about that so there is no need for you to pretend being that way for pleasing me or anybody.”</span></p><p>",""font-family:Arial;">“Is that why you don’t want me?”</span></p><p>",""font-family:Arial;">“That is exactly why I chose you Kyungsoo.”</span></p><p>",""font-family:Arial;">“Forgive me your- Jongin, but I don’t understand what you are implying.”</span></p><p>",""font-family:Arial;">“Others believe that I am already past the right age of settling down. It seems like as a king all of my accomplishments mean nothing if I don’t have an omega. I hate omegas.” The king growled, but then when Kyungsoo turned as stiff as a rock by his side he figured that he had chosen the wrong words.</span></p><p>",""font-family:Arial;">“Please don’t get the wrong idea. I meant the average omegas. That is why I chose you. I knew that you were nothing like a typical clingy omega who needs his alpha's attention all the time. I didn’t want a whiny mate and you looked like someone who could handle himself. I was really drawn to your independence and knowledge, your combat and managing skills.”</span></p><p>",""font-family:Arial;">“I hate you.” <i>Because you are a real jerk and you already said that you hate me… because you love that damn beta and you are a big liar. Kyungsoo kept his thoughts to himself.</i></span></p><p>",""font-family:Arial;">“I’m sorry for dragging you into this mess to escape from what is expected from me.”</span></p><p>",""font-family:Arial;">“You literally bought yourself another official, more like a prime minister, to dump your responsibilities on and here I thought you wanted a brooding mare.”</span></p><p>",""font-family:Arial;">“Don’t say it like that. It was far more complicated than this.”</span></p><p>",""font-family:Arial;">“You bought me like a cheap my king. I hate you.

For someone who is really angry you smell like you are petrified!”</span></p><p>",""font-family:Arial;">“You took everything that I knew and ever owned away from me and then kicked me aside like a bargaining chip and expect me to be alright? I am a foreigner in this strange land your highness. They don’t like me and I don’t know them enough to trust anybody. I am married to you and yet you haven’t bit me to claim me properly as if I’m a concubine. We are mates while we are complete strangers. It’s too much to take in, and you aren’t even trying to put yourself in my shoes even for a second.”</span></p><p>",""font-family:Arial;">“That is exactly why I haven’t done that yet. If you ever become my mate for what it truly means, I want it to be because we both want it and are ready for it and you just admitted that you are not. Besides, we already know that we quite think similarly, so that is something.”</span></p><p>",""font-family:Arial;">Kyungsoo stayed quiet for a few minutes and then the alpha pulled him closer to his clothed body. He popped his chin on top of Kyungsoo’s head and wrapped his arm loosely over his waist from over the blanket, avoiding touching his skin. The alpha was doing his best at being a gentleman.</span></p><p>",""font-family:Arial;">“Why are you doing this then?”</span></p><p>",""font-family:Arial;">Kyunsoo asked without even trying to get away from the king. For some unknown reason, he felt safe in that position and even enjoyed having his voice become muffled by the alpha’s tender neck.</span></p><p>",""font-family:Arial;">“I’m trying to comfort you I guess… blame it on the instincts.”</span></p> </div></div><div id="chapter-/story/view/1128859/7/violet-silk-angst-arrangedmarriage-mpreg-kaisoo-omegaverse-wolfau-royaltyau" class="row twelve columns chapter-container"><p style="font-weight: bold;">7 Chapter 07</p><div id="user-submitted-body" class="clearfix"><p><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">Kyungsoo woke up in an empty bed. He wondered if he had slept more than he should have, even though there weren’t any rules indicating that he should wake up at a particular time in the morning. Maybe there was one… but at least he didn’t know about it. He stayed lying in the alpha’s gigantic bed and rubbed his eyes before mustering up the power of waking up.</span></p><p>There was nobody in the chamber to assist him. The heavy velvet blanket was so warm and cosy and they felt very… soft on his bare skin. He wasn’t wearing any sleeping gowns when he went to sleep the previous night. He reluctantly pealed the blanket away and sat up. The room looked much more spacious in the daylight. He walked around in order to find his clothes, the ones that he had on last night, but those were nowhere to be found.</span></p><p>He sighed and tried to find a closet. It wouldn’t look good if he wore the king’s clothes but at this point he had no other choice. To his surprise there wasn’t a single closet in the room, or if there was one it was perfectly hidden from him as he couldn’t locate it.</span></p><p>His patience was growing thin as he failed to find anything to cover his body with. It was almost winter and he was feeling so cold that even the pinkish soft pads of his feet were freezing. He was hungry too, he barely had any diner the night before. What an amazing way of starting his day… and he had almost given up when he saw a piece of fabric on the couch near the window. The clothing was extremely similar to the satin navy-blue robe that the king had on last night. With a hopeful heart Kyungsoo made his way towards the couch. He picked the robe up and inspected it. He wondered if it was going to look too loose on his lithe body. He cursed who ever cleaned the room before he woke up and removed his apparel from the king’s chambers and forgot to get him a decent cloth to wear and left him hungry and alone.</span></p><p>In the end, he found himself nervously opening the door and peeking outside. He found his personal guards patrolling outside. If he had been at his father’s palace he shouldn’t walk out of these doors in such an undressed way. It was a different place with a slightly different set of rules, but Kyungsoo knew that as the king’s omega he should cover his body up.</span></p><p>He wasn’t , but the looks that the soldiers sent his way made him feel that way. He puffed his chest up and squared his shoulders. Kyungsoo looked at the nearest guard and asked him to lead him to his chambers. If the king was not lying last night, his belongings must already be unpacked in there.</span></p><p>At another side of the castle, King Jongin was feeling slightly guilty about leaving the omega prince alone in his room. He wondered if the prince would be able to find his way around the castle once he wakes up. As he was rushing through the hallways he got disturbed by a suspicious commotion. The staff were gathered around something, or more likely someone. The king stopped his steps and glanced at the crowd. Nobody sensed his presence. Their attention was already stolen by someone that he couldn’t see clearly.</span></p><p>King Jongin cleared his throat as he made his way toward the gathering. A maid saw him and yanked another woman aside. Like this they started to see him one by one. They hurriedly cleared his path, and then he saw him.</span></p><p>Prince Kyungsoo was standing right at the centre of the room. The king stopped a few meters away from him. He was wearing a shiny dark navy robe that was at least a few inches longer than him so its end was dreamingly laid on the white marble flooring. The contrast of the robe and the omega prince’s skin tone was mesmerising. His feet were bare. When the prince spotted him, and looked him with the most bothered expression that he had seen on him by far, he got thrown out from the trance that he had fallen into. His heart was banging at his rib cage as if it wanted to escape.</span></p><p>“Is everything alright my king? I hope that you are having a splendid morning.”</span></p><p>By hearing that the prince’s eyes got even more dangerous.</span></p><p>“If by splendid you mean starved to death then I have never had a better day in my life.” The prince argued.</span></p><p>King Jongin looked at the man standing next to the prince with a frown, wondering why that was an issue.</span></p><p>“Why would you not have breakfast now if I may ask?”</span></p><p>Kyungsoo bit his plump bottom lip hard and inhaled a sharp breath. “Because depending on your honourable staff it is past the breakfast time.”</span></p><p>“I don’t see why that should be an issue.”</span></p><p>“Your head chef here refuses to serve me my breakfast.” Kyungsoo said as he slightly turned his neck to glare at the chubby man standing next to him.</span></p><p>It was embarrassing and insulting. The king could not believe his ears when he heard it. He couldn’t believe that his staff had refused to feed an omega, much less <i>his</i> omega, right when he wanted to prove to the said omega that he could trust him. How could they even dare to turn the prince’s order down?! He would not dare to do that himself. His eyes were seeing red and he was hearing whispers.</span></p><p>“Prepare his royal majesty’s breakfast right now.”</span></p><p>“Your highness please forgive this servant. I am not allowed to.”</span></p><p>“It is your duty to comply when his royal highness asks you for anything. Who has told you to disobey him? He is your king and so am I, I do not tolerate this misbehaviour from anybody.”</span></p><p>The man kept silent.</span></p><p>“Answer!”</span></p><p>The alpha did not intend to impress the prince, but the way Prince Kyungsoo was looking at him with something in his eyes that was not fear or disgust or hatred, something that looked like hope and maybe just maybe admiration, was definitely boosting his ego.</span></p><p>“Her majesty has forbidden us.”</span></p><p>Whatever that was in Kyungsoo’s eyes mere seconds ago immediately disappeared. He emitted the cutest growl that the king had heard in his life and rushed away from the hall. His guards hurriedly ran after him.</span></p><p>King Jongin was confused and shocked at the same time. He was too shocked to run after the omega because his mother had finally showed up and because she had ordered the staff to not to listen to his husband. He might have hated the spoiled prince but his mother was something else.</span></p><p>Kyungsoo, however, was very keen on breaking every single rule about his kin. he was a scholar, a very skilled fighter by omega standards, and surprisingly a very good leader and adviser. The alpha king had realised that the officials were very fond of his omega’s knowledge and trusted him enough to seek his advice for many different topics. The omega even went as far as setting very critical plans and strategies. He must have felt proud as a mate, but they were only mates in front of the court and the subjects, and as a king he felt threatened by Kyungsoo’s rising influence and very often manipulation on his country. His country, not Kyungsoo’s…</span></p><p>“My king,” The alpha addressed his legal spouse with a tight smile.</span></p><p>“Yes, your imperial majesty?” Kyungsoo’s eyes were piercing.</span></p><p>“Even though your presence is very valuable in here I am afraid none of our honourable ministers and generals would agree that omegas should engage in the business of war.”</span></p><p>“hmm.” The omega nodded a few times and kept his chin high.</span></p><p>“I apologise for disagreeing with my lord, but I believe our men are far more intelligent to reject hearing their king’s… <i>the omega was not talking about him</i>. …mere opinion on such an important subject, just because of him being from an<i> inferior kind</i>.”</span></p><p>“Omegas are not inferior to us! I refuse to stay at a conference where they are treated as such.” An old alpha general replied. He had five omega children King Jongin bitterly remembered.</span></p><p>He was not looking down on Kyungsoo. He would not dare to do so. He knew about the omega's abilities. He just did not know Kyungsoo as a person. He just did not trust him or his intentions yet.</span></p><p>“I have no objections in that case.” The admittance felt like losing a war.</span></p><p>The omega prince was given a small mansion as his residence right across the king’s personal chambers. The place was connected to the king's sleeping chamber by a short one minute walking distance. It was right at his personal gardens. It looked as if the prince was separated from the entire court and kept under restrictions.</span></p><p>The alpha thought that maybe it was the reason why the place was built there at the first place. The palace was old. Older than his grandfather who had ordered the mansion to be built at such an odd place, almost separated from the rest of the palace. The man had probably wanted to keep his queen sheltered… Keep her just to himself. Jongin ignored the pang of jealousy that he felt in his heart.</span></p><p>He had never paid much attention to the mansion before the prince started living there. Now that the place was occupied it was almost impossible to ignore it, and the alpha felt like he was invading the omega’s privacy every time he was watching the scenery or taking a walk on those grounds that they shared as husbands.</span></p><p>It might have been perfect if Kyungsoo was not so independent. His alpha instincts wanted the prince to be a docile omega, someone that would at least depend on him or he could just protect…</span></p><p>Kyungsoo as a person was a puzzle that the king was trying to solve. On sunny days, he often found the prince sitting by himself on the grass nearby the artificial ponds, doing something… He kept staring and observing, and the omega would just sit there for hours just to pet the tiny animals that they kept there. They had fuzzy little bunnies and ducks. The omega would let them lean against his thighs and nap on his lap. The sight was something that would haunt the king during his days and nights.</span></p><p>The palace was under a chaos ever since his mother has stepped into it. She was obviously displeased by his son’s choice of mate and did absolutely nothing to conceal her dislike towards the omega prince.</span></p><p>Kyungsoo knew something was wrong when he realised no one from the royal family was present at his wedding. He just did not expect the situation to be this corrupted.</span></p><p>The ex-queen, whom Kyungsoo had apparently taken away her title by marring his son, especially without asking for her permission, was sickeningly similar to those vicious mother-in-laws in the tales that he was told as a child.</span></p><p>She kept embarrassing him in front of the king and the court ladies. Most of the time she would pester him about his lack of manners, even though Kyungsoo was an extremely mannered and polite individual. Those manners though turned out to be omega manners. Kyungsoo decided to give up on trying to be friends with her because she had already declared a war between them.</span></p><p>Kyungsoo was not some omega to give a damn about running the household, changing decorations, planning a meal, setting up events and designing the gardens, however he knew that those rights were reserved to him and him only. Not the ex-queen. She had her own little palace to spend her retirement at but instead she was here, breeching every barrier between them. So, he got involved into all of those. The woman needed to know who was in charge and she needed to know it fast.</span></p><p><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">The result of this fight was a disaster. The king was pissed beyond his tolerance. His mother was against this marriage and he still did it without her consent, so of course Kyungsoo had to pay for it, but the king was having a hard time too. Kyungsoo was not someone to nag to his alpha, in fact he never nagged, until one day.</span></p><p>“Your mother has closed down the hospital which I have built with my own money. I have never complained about anything my king, but I cannot close my eyes on this-“</span></p><p>“Stop!” the king shouted, surprising the prince.</span></p><p>He kept his tone high as he watched the tears pool at the omega’s eyes. The boy kept flinching and recoiling on himself every time his voice peaked.</span></p><p>“Stop acting like a victim, Kyungsoo!”</span></p><p>“I… I…”</span></p><p>“You what?!”</span></p><p>“Why are you shouting? What have I done wrong? Why do you hate me?”</span></p><p>“You dare to ask me these questions?!”</span></p><p>Kyungsoo was confused.</span></p><p>“you think you came here as a hostage, Kyungsoo, while I am the one who is in chains. Your father traded our marriage to a war that I could never save my people from. We are living with his men under this roof. Even now that I have raised my voice over you he is going to hear about it. Why do you think you are titled 'king'? Do you really think I am that naive to just share“He threatened you?” Kyungsoo asked, stunned by the king’s angry confession.</span></p><p>“Yes.” The king replied coldly. It was not Kyungsoo’s fault. He was having a very hard time too. The alpha was not blind; he could see the rejection and sadness on the omega’s face.</span></p><p>“I did not know any of this.” the omega whispered.</span></p><p>“I apologise.”</span></p><p>“you shouldn’t.” The king whispered breathlessly.</span></p><p>“Now I know the reason why her majesty and my lord hate me.”</span></p><p>“I…” he did not hate the omega. He wanted to say it.</span></p><p>“I will retrieve to my bed chambers if you would allow me to. I have to rest.” The omega rushed away.</span></p> </div></div></div>    </div><script src="js/asianFanfiction.js"></script></body></html>"],"nbsp;</span><a href":""https://www.asianfanfics.com/story/view/886323/kaisoo-wolf-fic-collection-wolf-kaisoo-omegaverse-wolfau-omegaverseau" style="font-family:'helvetica neue';font-size:14px;color:rgb(65,110,210);text-decoration:none;"><u>kaisoo wolf fic collection</u></a><span style="color:rgb(79,50,28);"></span></span></span></p><div><p style":""color:rgb(79,50,28);font-family:Charter;font-size:19px;"><span style="font-family:arial;"><span style="font-size:14px;">Feel free to check my other stories:</span></span></p><ul><li style":""color:rgb(79,50,28);font-family:Charter;font-size:19px;"><span style="font-family:arial;"><span style="font-size:14px;"><a href="https://www.asianfanfics.com/story/view/1043850/jasmine-drama-vampire-mpreg-kaisoo-krisoo-marriagecontract" style="color:rgb(65,110,210);text-decoration:none;"><u>Jasmine</u></a>(":M":""color:rgb(79,50,28);font-family:Charter;font-size:19px;"><span style="font-family:arial;"><span style="font-size:14px;"><a href="https://www.asianfanfics.com/story/view/1124855" style="font-family:'helvetica neue';font-size:14px;color:rgb(65,110,210);text-decoration:none;"><u>Can I Borrow Your Knot?</u></a>,"nbsp;(they are both abo!au with top, alpha Kyungsoo and omega jongin)</span></span></li><li style":""color:rgb(79,50,28);font-family:Charter;font-size:19px;"><span style="font-family:arial;"><span style="font-size:14px;"><font face="arial"><span style="font-size:14px;"><a href="https://www.asianfanfics.com/story/view/1197467/castle-of-glass-angst-arrangedmarriage-romance-kaisoo-royaltyau"><u>Castle Of Glass</u></a>: ([M], royalty!au / arranged marriage / top jongin / drabble / ongoing)</span></font></span></span></li></ul><hr><p>Many thanksto my amazing friend <a href":""https://www.asianfanfics.com/profile/view/727536">cm0nster</a> who is kindly betaing the fiction.</p><p><font face="arial">This beautiful poster is created by one of my lovely readers :)</font></p><p><font face":""arial">thank you so much <a href="https://www.asianfanfics.com/profile/view/1264424"><b><i><u>dreamntell</u></i></b></a></font></p><p></p></div> </div></div></div>        <div class":""row story-container" id="story-container"><div id="chapter-/story/view/1128859/1/violet-silk-angst-arrangedmarriage-mpreg-kaisoo-omegaverse-wolfau-royaltyau" class="row twelve columns chapter-container"><p style="font-weight: bold;">1 Chapter 01</p><div id="user-submitted-body" class="clearfix"><p><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">It's been a few days that the palace has been in a big chaos. Everyone has been getting ready for his departure. They were all acting so cheerful that Kyungsoo wondered if they've always been waiting for this moment, when they would get rid of him forever and completely forget him, especially the king; his father…</span></p><p><br><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">Kyungsoo has always been different from his brothers, as he was the pup that his parents didn't plan to have. Who wants an omega as a child? He had always been overshadowed and ignored his entire life, no matter how hard he tried to be better than his alpha brothers. He had always fought his delicate omega instincts to build a strong façade and prove to his father that he was equally as good, if not better, than his brothers in fighting and politics. Kyungsoo fought to show him that he hated sweets and cute things, and he acted like he couldn't differentiate the flower scents when he could, acted like he couldn't paint beautiful details and had no talent or sense at any kind of arts while he knew that his hands were way more talented than those of the private teachers who had always told his parents that he was too tough to be an omega. And they foolishly believed them.</span></p><p><br><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">He thought that his fate was to die alone in his chambers at his father's palace. That's what always happened to the other omega offspring in their dynasty because no one was worthy of such a perfect omega. Kyungsoo might not have the most sculpted body but in his wolf form, he was even bigger and more invincible than his alpha father, which meant that he could carry healthy and fine litters and protect them perfectly, something that he was the best at, but was not allowed to do.</span></p><p><br><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">Where omegas were considered as property and were treated like slaves, an omega like him was priceless. As far as his history classes with his old and strict professors who smelled like libraries had taught him, he was going to be treasured and was expected to serve his nation. He belonged to everyone and every single pack inside the borders of their kingdom, especially to his alpha brothers. He was supposed to be a sacred being and their sanctuary.</span></p><p><br><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">He knew that his father wasn't fond of him, and that he didn't care if he was dead or alive, but he never would have imagined that he'd actually sell him off like any other peasant omega. But, maybe he should have anticipated it when even the noble families traded their omegas for lands or shares and fortune. </span></p><p><br><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">His father, the king, had made the best deal with King Jongin. </span></p><p><br><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">The man that he was betrothed to, or better said sold to, was the ruler of a country that held the territories of a few of the most powerful packs and mother nature had gifted it with mines of the finest jewelleries and fertile soil.</span></p><p><br><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">He didn't know exactly what he has been traded for, but he knew that his father would have never let such a huge opportunity slip out of his claws.</span></p><p><br><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">Kyungsoo was only twenty-three, while King Jongin was already thirty-five years old. He wouldn't have minded the age gap if the man wasn't already mated to another. </span></p><p><br><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">Despite his parent’s efforts in keeping that as a secret from him, he had heard the whispers in the corridors, and as far as the gossips went, the beta that his fiancé was mated to was barren. He didn't even know if the said beta was a male or a female. The king and that wolf’s affairs were not publicly announced, so nobody knew if the king had actually claimed him/her yet or if he loved that person, or if she/he was just a mere concubine to satisfy the needs of the king.</span></p><p><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">One thing that Kyungsoo knew for sure was that he was chosen to be the one to give the king a litter of alpha pups as his own mother had once happily told him.</span></p><p><br><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">He knew that the land that he was going to call home from now on had no queen yet, which meant that he would probably be the one who gets that crown right after he gets pregnant, or maybe after he gives birth to at least one alpha Prince. Another, more convincing scenario is that he'll probably be used as a breeding machine and after that he will be tossed away immediately.</span></p><p><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">He was either going to become a concubine or something more. He could be the next queen or, in other words, a house wrecker, which would be the case if the king had some sort of feelings for the other one.</span></p><p><br><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">Although he was brought up to become a saint and a guardian angel for his family, and most importantly for his people, he didn't want to be used. As far as he knew and could predict, the king was going to use him until he got pregnant, and then he'll be separated from his pups. When that does happen, he will have no choice but to endure everything and anything that comes his way, because he knew better than anyone else that he won't be welcome in his family anymore. Who knows what kind of fate awaits him in that kingdom?</span></p><p><br><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">He was determined to not let that alpha hurt him and take his pups away like that. He thought that he might be a slave now, and let them call him a house wrecker or a , but he was going to change that. He was going to make sure that the king would become his slave before he gets any chance to hurt him.</span></p> </div></div><div id="chapter-/story/view/1128859/2/violet-silk-angst-arrangedmarriage-mpreg-kaisoo-omegaverse-wolfau-royaltyau" class="row twelve columns chapter-container"><p style="font-weight: bold;">2 Chapter 02</p><div id="user-submitted-body" class="clearfix"><p><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">As he grew up, Kyungsoo became very good at hiding his emotions from everyone except his mother. Maybe she could read him like an open book because she was an omega herself, or perhaps she just knew him even better than himself.<br><br>He was going to leave his family tomorrow morning; therefore, his mother came to his room with many packed suits. However, they ended up opening most of them so she could show him everything that she'd ordered or bought him.<br><br>It was always hard for him to put up the same act in front of her. He was especially having a hard time doing that when she took a pretty turquoise bracelet out of one of the many boxes that were carelessly scattered around the floor. When it was the time for them to go to bed Kyungsoo felt like crying. He hated the fact that he couldn't see her anytime that he wants to, or when he simply misses her anymore, but she didn't let him breakdown that night. They laidnext to each other on his bed, trying to make the most out of the remaining hours that they had left together.</span></p><p><br><span style":""font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">She traced the outline of his face with her fingertips before kissing each of his cheeks. It had been so long since the last time that Kyungsoo had let her do that, and he regretted all the good night kisses that he had rejected for the sake of looking strong.</span></p><p><br><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">“Kyungsoo, there are a few things that no one is going to tell you if I don't, so I want you to listen to every single word that I'm going to say carefully.”</span></p><p><br><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">Kyungsoo held her hand and looked at her light brown pupils, waiting for her to begin speaking.</span></p><p><br><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">“I've seen King Jongin before. He is really handsome Kyungsoo, he’s going to be a good mate to you so I don't want you to worry yourself.”</span></p><p><br><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">“What about that beta?” Kyungsoo asked her and she sighed before answering.</span></p><p><br><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">“I thought you didn't know about him.”</span></p><p><br><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">“So, it's a man?”</span></p><p><br><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">“I don’t know either. I just guessed. Look Kyungsoo, I know that you are worried about that person, but you need to know that it's absolutely pointless. Nobody in that country knows about that person and you are going to officially marry the king in front of everyone. He would only care about you after he claims you at the ceremony.”</span></p><p><br><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">“I don’t think I'll be able to let him have me… after he bites me.”</span></p><p><br><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">“Trust me, you'll want him to take you. That's what the claiming does. You see, omegas aren't allowed to claim an alpha and why do you think it's like that?”</span></p><p><br><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">“I don't know, I've never thought about it.”</span></p><p><br><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">“Because then they will feel the same longing for their mates, and their bond with their mate would get much stronger because of the way that their mate would be the only thing that they care about. It’s not because the claim messes with their heads, it's because they will feel their omega’s love and care for them, how they feel, what makes them happy, and what frightens them. Centuries ago, when the packs started to fight with each other, the wolves decided to only let the alphas do the claiming so they would be able to leave their mates’ sides and fight with the enemies without any unnecessary distraction.”</span></p><p><br><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">“Why are you telling me these things?”</span></p><p><br><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">“Because I think you should claim him Kyungsoo. It's been centuries since that tradition had died.”</span></p><p><br><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">“An alpha as strong as a king would never allow that.”</span></p><p><br><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">“If you want him all for yourself, then you need to take the risk.”</span></p><p><br><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">“How am I supposed to do it?”</span></p><p><br><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">“I was thinking a lot about it recently… You should do it when he…”</span></p><p><br><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">His mother looked away for a second.</span></p><p><br><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">“You know what? I won't have another chance to tell you these things, so I'll just say them all. You should bite him when he knots you.”</span></p><p><br><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">“What?! Mommm~~”</span></p><p><br><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">“Just… Listen to me son. If you do it at that time, he won't be able to run away from you and he won't be strong enough to fight against it. It's for the best.”</span></p><p><br><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">“I- I'll try to do it.”</span></p><p><br><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">“About your first night with him-“</span></p><p><br><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">“Mom please~”</span></p><p><br><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">“It will hurt, but it won't last long. You'll enjoy it eventually. It's your first time, right?”</span></p><p><br><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">“Yes.” Kyungsoo shyly answered.</span></p><p><br><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">“Omegas are more possessive than one might think. I can imagine that if the beta comes in your way you might want to do anything to get rid of him or her. But, do not do anything stupid. Your mate won't want anyone else but you, so if you do anything to hurt him or her it would only give your mate a reason to doubt you. Just sit back and do not do anything that you'll end up regretting.”</span></p><p><br><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">“It's not as easy as you make it sound like.”</span></p><p><br><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">“We don't know anything for sure, Kyungsoo. You have to trust yourself. He really wanted to have you, you should have seen him when he was proposing. Besides, no one can be compared with you. I know it and he knows it too.”</span></p><p><br><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">“Any more advice?”</span></p><p><br><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">“You tend to act like someone you are not, but you don't have to do that in front of him. If you needed anything or didn't like something just tell him. Alphas can't tell what makes you mad, so they'll end up getting mad too and then it won't be pretty. Be honest, straight forward, and don't try to be someone you are not. You are not a submissive omega, so don't try being like one to please him, it'll only make you frustrated. Since you are going to live with that man, he needs to know the real you to be able to understand you.”</span></p><p><br><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">“He is a jerk who only wants me for making babies, and you are telling me about understanding?! He would never bother himself to get to know me.”</span></p><p><br><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">They talked and talked about everything and nothing until they both fell asleep at some point.</span></p><p><br><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">______________________________________________________________________________________________</span></p><p><br><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">When Kyungsoo stepped out of the carriage, which King Jongin had sent to their palace a few weeks ago, his legs were feeling numb. He ended up stumbling on them, but before he hit the ground he was held up by a pair of hands around his waist. The country was very beautiful indeed, and as far as his eyes could see the land was covered with green plants. He closed his eyes and was enjoying the freshness of the air when he heard a deep warm voice addressing him.</span></p><p><br><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">“Welcome to your new home, my dear prince.”</span></p><p><br><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">Kyungsoo was startled for a few seconds when he realized that the man who was holding him had spoken to him. He turned around to look at the man.</span></p><p><br><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">“We have been anticipating your arrival for days, so I came to personally accompany you to the palace during the remainder of the journey.”</span></p><p><br><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">“And whom you might be?” Kyungsoo asked the man.</span></p><p><br><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">“King Jongin your highness.” The man half bowed while removing his hat and Kyungsoo nervously did the same.</span></p><p><br><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">“Please forgive my rudeness your majesty. The trip seems to have worn me out.”</span></p><p><br><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">“I absolutely understand how you feel. Let's get going then, shall we?”</span></p><p><br><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">“Of course.”</span></p><p><br><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">The king offered him his hand, and held Kyungsoo's hand over his forearm to lead him to another carriage that was a few meters away from the one that he'd been riding for the past couple of days.</span></p><p><br><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">When they entered the carriage, Kyungsoo couldn't stop thinking about how handsome the king is, or the depth of his eyes while looking at him. He had been lost in his thoughts when the carriage began moving, and neither of them said a word. He decided to keep quiet unless the king talked to him first. </span></p><p><br><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">A few minutes were spent like that, until the king took something out of his tailored coat’s pocket. He then brought it across Kyungsoo's face.</span></p><p><br><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">“What is that your majesty?”</span></p><p><br><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">“This is the royal family’s symbol.” He pointed at the golden pendant that was hanging from his fingertips. The necklace was decorated with some dark blue gems and black and white diamonds.</span></p><p><br><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">“It's… Beautiful.”</span></p><p><br><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">“I'd like you to put it on. I have one too.” The king showed him his own necklace that was hidden beneath his dress shirt, although his was slightly bigger and simpler compared to Kyungsoo's.</span></p><p><br><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">“Can I see it please?”</span></p><p><br><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">“Sure.” The king placed it in Kyungsoo's awaiting hand.</span></p><p><br><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">“Do you want me to put it on for you?”</span></p><p><br><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">Kyungsoo liked to do things independently, so he politely declined the help and did it himself effortlessly. When he looked up from the pendant he saw that the king had buttoned his shirt wrongly. Kyungsoo wanted to ignore it, but he didn't want the people who'll welcome him when they arrive at the palace to have any wrong ideas.</span></p><p><br><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">“I believe you've buttoned your shirt hurriedly your highness …” Kyungsoo worried his bottom lip between his teeth as the king tried to find out which button was fastened incorrectly, but wasn't able to make any progress at it.</span></p><p><br><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">“Uhm…, can you perhaps fix it for me please?”</span></p><p><br><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">Kyungsoo nodded and inclined toward him. His eye sight wasn't so good, so he needed to get his eyes really close to the buttons to be able to fix them properly with his deft fingers. When he opened the top three buttons to fasten them again, the king’s scent reached his nose, stronger than anything that he's ever smelled. He realized that he has been too close to him. Close enough to feel the king's warm breath hitting his scalp, and he sat still, holding the same position because king Jongin was sniffing his hair, which were probably all over the man's face, and his own nose was right next to the king’s neck. Then the king's sniffing turned into deep breaths that were followed by a satisfied hum.</span></p><p><br><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">“I- I'm done.” Kyungsoo said, and pulled away from him. He was somehow confused and startled by the king's actions.</span></p><p><br><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">The rest of the ride was spent in silence, and soon enough they reached the castle where they parted their ways to rest and get ready for the upcoming ceremony.</span></p><p></p> </div></div><div id":[""chapter-/story/view/1128859/3/violet-silk-angst-arrangedmarriage-mpreg-kaisoo-omegaverse-wolfau-royaltyau" class="row twelve columns chapter-container"><p style="font-weight: bold;">3 Chapter 03</p><div id="user-submitted-body" class="clearfix"><p><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">Kyungsoo had never seen scenery more beautiful than this. In King Jongin's kingdom everything was at least ten times more beautiful than in his home land. The Kim’s palace was huge and it was lavishly and generously decorated. Every small detail screamed of its owners’ wealth and luxurious taste of materials. The Italian marble floors were covered with hand woven Persian rugs, and the huge wall length windows framing the breath-taking views of the gardens were adorned by Indian silk curtains.</span></p><p><br><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">The Kim’s obviously had more money to spare than his own family. King Jongin had left him by the main door at the hands of the head of servants in the palace. A man was assigned to be his guide and give him a tour of the entire palace and introduce him to the important workers and officials that they would meet during the tour and their visits to the different places. </span></p><p><br><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">Kyungsoo knew that he had to get to know the place that he was going to spend the rest of his life at, but he just didn't understand why it had to be now, right after his long journey to this foreign kingdom.<br><br>The fact that the palace was so huge with a really complicated, not to mention artistic, architecture only meant that looking at its every nook and cranny would at least take hours.</span></p><p><br><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">It was already past his normal sleeping time by the time that he was dismissed and guided to a guest room that he was going to be staying at until the wedding ceremony, which was going to be held at the following day. The room, just like the rest of the palace, was furnished with the finest pieces although it only contained the basics.</span></p><p>",""chapter-/story/view/1128859/4/violet-silk-angst-arrangedmarriage-mpreg-kaisoo-omegaverse-wolfau-royaltyau" class="row twelve columns chapter-container"><p style="font-weight: bold;">4 Chapter 04</p><div id="user-submitted-body" class="clearfix"><p><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">After the unexpected announcement, Kyungsoo and King Jongin were supposed to join their guests at the royal palace to celebrate their wedding with them. They rode in the same carriage to the palace, and Kyungsoo was not sure but he concluded that they must have been riding in King Jongin’s personal carriage.</span></p><p>",""chapter-/story/view/1128859/8/violet-silk-angst-arrangedmarriage-mpreg-kaisoo-omegaverse-wolfau-royaltyau" class="row twelve columns chapter-container"><p style="font-weight: bold;">8 Chapter 08</p><div id="user-submitted-body" class="clearfix"><p><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">Everything happened very fast. The speed at which Kyungsoo had settled into his position was mind-blowing. It was during a typical boring meeting that Kyungsoo decided to show off his position. He walked in with confidence and sat himself right in front of King Jongin, at the other end of the dark wooden table at the centre of the war strategy room. Following his arrival, many heads snapped to his direction staring at him some with amused faces and some with grim judging looks. The king was not happy at all. Planning war or defence was absolutely out of question for omegas. That was what King Jongin and most of his men believed.</span></p><p>"],"nbsp;</p><p>":["","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""],"nbsp;</span><span style":""font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">Kyungsoo was tough, and he definitely didn’t need an alpha’s protection, but for some reason that was unbeknownst to him being in a close proximity to King Jongin made him feel more at home and much less anxious.</span></p><p><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">During the whole night, he was constantly worried that he might offend somebody and embarrass both himself and the king, for he wasn’t familiar to their tradition, but luckily he was successful since nobody looked pissed. Even if he had made any mistakes they either hadn’t minded it, or maybe they had simply ignored him.</span></p><p></div></div></div> </div></div><div id":""chapter-/story/view/1128859/5/violet-silk-angst-arrangedmarriage-mpreg-kaisoo-omegaverse-wolfau-royaltyau" class="row twelve columns chapter-container"><p style="font-weight: bold;">5 Chapter 05</p><div id="user-submitted-body" class="clearfix"><p><span style="font-family:'-webkit-standard', serif;">They left the main ballroom hand in hand, and Kyungsoo’s palm was cold and clammy as the king noticed. He silently looked at the omega’s hand as they were walking through the hallways. The hand was smaller than his and it was perfectly fitted in his tight grasp. He hadn't realized how hard he has been holding the omega prince’s hand until he saw that his nails had almost turned white from the amount of pressure.</span></p><p></p><p><br><span style":[""font-family:Arial;">“Yes, well, my chambers aren't ready yet, whatever that it's supposed to mean.”</span></p><p>",""font-family:Arial;">“The staff is preparing the late queen’s chambers for you.
